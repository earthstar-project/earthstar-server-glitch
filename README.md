Want your own Earthstar server?

1. Click the button above.
2. Create a file at `.data/known_shares.json`
3. Add the shares you'd like your replica server to know about as an array, like
   this: `["+myshare.xxxx", "+yourshare.xxxx"]`
4. Check the logs for the URL to sync with!

If you'd like to further customise your server, you can learn more about servers
and their extensions at the main
[Earthstar repo](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar/blob/main/README_SERVERS.md).
